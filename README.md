# Help Me Start Up

The world is slowly becoming more and more technical. The rising cost of
education is causing a barrier of entry for students. This project is an
endeavor to allow students to connect with technology companies for potential
internships and/or scholarships.

## Are you a student?

Does the rising cost of education worry you? Has anyone mentioned that a
university education only earns you a diploma? With HMSU, you are able to
earn great experience by searching for internships at your local technology
companies.

## Are you a tech company?

Do you have unrelated tasks assigned to many employees? With HMSU, you can
hire the right people to take on these tasks.

Not interest in providing internships? Then do good in your community by 
offering scholarships to students. HMSU lets you define your own criteria for
providing scholarships; we do the leg work of finding good candidates for you.
